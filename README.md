# Proyecto_II
In the United States, whenever there is a presidential election, the votes are separated by state due to the electoral college. 
In Mexico, we do not have this method for voting, so in the news we never see the votes separated by state, 
so we decided to take on this task to see who was the most voted candidate by state.

We will be using official INE data from: https://www.ine.mx/transparencia/datos-abiertos/#/archivo/resultados-elecciones-presidente-de-la-republica
